        <h1>Contact A.L.F.A Errortronics</h1>
        <p>Welcome to A.L.F.A Errortronics, the electronics wonderland hidden in the depths of Grandma's basement. Need to get in touch with us? We're here for you, cat interruptions and all!</p>

        <h2>Contact Information</h2>
        <p>You can reach us through various unconventional channels:</p>

        <h3>Email</h3>
        <p>Email: <a href="mailto:grandma@alfaerrortronics.com">grandma@alfaerrortronics.com</a></p>
        <p>We promise, Grandma's emails are as warm as her apple pie, and she'll respond with plenty of tech advice and maybe a joke or two.</p>

        <h3>Phone</h3>
        <p>Phone: <a href="tel:+1234567890">+1 (404) 56E-RROR or +1 (404) 563-7767</a></p>
        <p>Our phone lines are occasionally answered by Buttons, the tech-savvy cat. If you hear meowing, don't be alarmed; it's just a call from the basement.</p>

        <h3>Snail Mail</h3>
        <p>If you prefer the good old snail mail method, you can send your letters to:</p>

        <p>Grandma's Basement</p>
        <p>123 Basement Ave</p>

        <p>Expect a handwritten response with a hint of nostalgia, possibly a tea stain or two.</p>
