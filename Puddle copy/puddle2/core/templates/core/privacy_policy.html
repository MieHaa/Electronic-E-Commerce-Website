        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p>Welcome to A.L.F.A Errortronics, the tech treasure trove tucked away in someone's grandma's basement. Our Privacy Policy is as quirky as our location, so let's dive right in:</p>

        <h2>1. Data Collection</h2>
       <p>We collect data as if it's the forgotten treasures at the back of Grandma's closet. We may gather your name, email, address, and your payment info, but rest assured, your secrets are safe with us.</p>


       <h2>2. Cookies</h2>
       <p>We do use cookies, but not the digital kind. Ours are made from Grandma's secret recipe.</p>


       <h2>3. Data Security</h2>
       <p>Your data is as safe as Grandma's famous meatloaf recipe. We protect it with all our might, and we promise to never share your data with a third party without your written consent. And no sharing others' information without their consent either!</p>


       <h2>4. Cat Interference</h2>
       <p>If you hear a meow during your call with grandma or one of our representatives, don't be alarmed. It's just Buttons, our furry assistant. He occasionally listens in and meows during calls, walks on the keyboard and sends you gibberish emails, so we apologize in advance.</p>


       <h2>5. Changes to the Policy</h2>
       <p>If we ever update our Privacy Policy, you'll be the first to know. Grandma might also email you a new cookie recipe. Keep an eye on that inbox!</p>


       <h2>6. Legal Stuff</h2>
       <p>While we're a bit unconventional, we take your privacy seriously. If you have any concerns or questions, please reach out. Grandma will respond personally, and you might even get a story from her younger days.</p>


        <p>By visiting A.L.F.A Errortronics, you agree to this whimsical Privacy Policy. Thanks for being a part of our basement-based adventure!</p>
